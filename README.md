## State

Package which is sent to a post office, the package itself can be ordered, then delivered to a post office and finally

## Visitor

## Template Method

## Mediator

Imagine we're building a simple cooling system that consists of a fan, a power supply, and a button. Pressing the button
will either turn on or turn off the fan. Before we turn the fan on, we need to turn on the power. Similarly, we have to 
turn off the power right after the fan is turned off.

Create a simple SQL-like syntax in an object-oriented way, which will be then interpreted and return us the result.
